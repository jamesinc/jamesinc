## Hi, I'm James, and here's my life story üß±

I'm a software engineer always looking for interesting problems to solve! I've been around the track a few times, I started coding as a 12-year-old in 1999 by looking at the source code of websites. In 2001 I picked up VBScript, and in 2002 I started learning JavaScript, only prior to web-2.0 everyone called it DHTML!

In my early career I ran a business (StudioJ) that specialised in producing semantic, standards-based websites for SMEs. I moved to full-time work for a digital agency where I spent most of my time working in C# and built a multi-browser automation harness on top of Selenium, which I'm still proud of today even though modern tools are much more sophisticated. The team I worked for built all the websites for the AFL, NRL, üèà and Supercars! üèé We used to have a great time on Supercars race day because the company that provided trackside live timing would always screw up their data stream, so the on-call would sometimes have to fill in lap times by hand, by watching the live coverage on the TV üòÖ

I eventually found my way into financial services almost by accident, and ened up building SPA tools to help people save for their retirement and find insurance products that meet their needs. It was interesting, and I ended up having an amazing niche knowledge of [Flot charts](https://github.com/flot/flot). üìà

By 2014 I was getting a bit bored of front-end development, and an opportunity presented itself to pivot into building cloud-based applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS). I spent the first year or two moving on-prem software into Amazon EC2 and RDS. When Amazon Lambda was released, I got really excited and started using it for everything (I even made a t-shirt with the slogan _Lambda Opportunity_ haha, what a nerd ü§ì)

I left financial services for a role running operations for RSVP, an online dating platform in Australia (as well as Oasis.com). That was a wild ride, as I found myself trying to manage a platform that was distributed across three continents, with incredible amounts of legacy (as in, this platform contained ColdFusion and NodeJS and everything in-between). While modernising these systems, I developed the _cases of beer saved per week_ approach to cost optimsation, which management was able to intuitively understand, and which was nicely visualised on a whiteboard in the office. At RSVP I picked up Ruby, which I hate.

Finally, I joined [Versent](https://github.com/Versent) where I have delved deep into Amazon's service-space and develop heavily automated platform infrastructure. Here I picked up Python, which I love. Stop what you are doing and immediately go and learn Python.


### Side-projects

To be honest I'm not a hobby software engineer. In my spare time I am usually in my garage doing physical engineering, building cars, making parts for cars, machining things, that sort of thing.

I do however run [Oz Volvo](https://ozvolvo.org) a forum for Australian Volvo fans, and I periodically contribute to [Vanilla](https://github.com/vanilla/vanilla), the open-source PHP-based forum software that Oz Volvo runs on.


### Other metadata

I enjoy mentoring engineers and working collaboratively and inclusively. I am a feminist. I try not to be a prick. I still open the browser console regularly to see how things work üòÄ
