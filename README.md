## Hi, I'm James

I'm a software engineer always looking for interesting problems to solve! I've been around the track a few times. I enjoy mentoring engineers and working collaboratively and inclusively. I am a feminist. I try not to be a prick. After all these years I still open the browser console regularly to see how things work üòÄ

I am a craftsman in everything I do. I don't know everything, but I try to learn when given the opportunity and I consider the things I create to be a reflection of who I am. I don't write code I wouldn't happily put my name to, period. Quality and fitness-for-purpose first, deadline second. Making it so that the two concerns don't clash? That's just good planning.

### Here's my rambling life story

My first computer was a hand-me-down Apple IIc, and I got really into [Moon Patrol](http://virtualapple.org/moonpatroldisk.html). I started coding HTML as a 12-year-old in 1999 by looking at the source code of websites. In 2002 I picked up VBScript and in 2003 I started learning JavaScript (then popularly known as DHTML). Back then, CSS was a fairly new thing, and my first websites made little or no use of it. If you wanted rounded corners, you had to create a `<table>` with cells and columns for each corner, and the corner itself was a sprite. üò¨

Soon after I got into PHP and ColdFusion, though never did much with the ColdFusion. I also became interested in Linux (I still recall buying Red Hat 7.x on CD from the newsagent down the road, along with a magazine about all things GNU/Linux) as well as Windows domain-based environments (the hell kind of teenager was I?). My family home had roaming profiles, and I used the second phone line to act as an ISP for my friend whose parents didn't want to pay for Internet.

After finishing high school I studied Industrial Design at UNSW, but quit after two years before eventually undertaking a B Sc. Information Technology at UTS, starting in 2007, though I spent most of my time in the Sydney University Faculty of Architecture writing skit comedy stageplays. Go figure.

In my early career I ran a business (StudioJ) that specialised in producing semantic, standards-based websites for SMEs. I worked part-time for a few other small web development studios, and it was in 2007 that a colleague got me interested in [MooTools](https://mootools.net/), a forerunner to jQuery, and from there I got properly into JavaScript. I remember when FireBug was first released, what a revolution in web development that was!

I moved to full-time work for a digital agency where I spent most of my time working in JavaScript or C#, and built a multi-browser regression testing automation harness on top of [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), which I'm still proud of today even though modern tools are much more sophisticated. The team I worked for built all the websites for the AFL, NRL, üèà and Supercars üèé

I eventually found my way into financial services almost by accident, and ened up building SPA tools to help people save for their retirement and find insurance products that meet their needs. It was interesting, and I ended up with an amazing niche knowledge of [Flot charts](https://github.com/flot/flot). üìà

By 2014 I was getting a bit bored of front-end development, and an opportunity presented itself to pivot into building cloud-based applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS). I spent the first year or two moving on-prem software into Amazon EC2 and RDS. When Amazon Lambda was released, I got really excited and started using it for everything (I even made a t-shirt with the slogan _Lambda Opportunity_ haha, what a nerd ü§ì)

I left financial services for a role running operations for RSVP, an online dating platform in Australia (as well as Oasis.com). That was a wild ride, as I found myself trying to manage a platform that was distributed across three continents, with incredible amounts of legacy (as in, this platform contained **ColdFusion** and **NodeJS** and everything in-between). While modernising these systems, I developed the _cases of beer saved per week_ approach to cost optimsation, which management was able to intuitively understand, and which was nicely visualised on a whiteboard in the office. At RSVP I picked up **Ruby**, which I hate.

Finally, I joined [Versent](https://github.com/Versent) where I have delved deep into Amazon's service-space and develop heavily automated platform infrastructure. From here I primarily wrote **Python**, which I love. Stop what you are doing and immediately go and learn Python.


### Side-projects

To be honest I'm not a hobby software engineer. In my spare time I am usually in my garage doing the other kind of engineering, building cars, making parts for cars, machining things, that sort of thing.

I do however run [Oz Volvo](https://ozvolvo.org) a forum for Australian Volvo fans, and I periodically contribute to [Vanilla](https://github.com/vanilla/vanilla), the open-source PHP-based forum software that Oz Volvo runs on. Managing an active community and organising events takes up a good chunk of my free time.
