## Hello

I'm James, a mostly-self-taught software engineer. In 1999 I found the _View Source_ button in Internet Explorer and the rest is history. I hold a **B Sc. Information Technology** and have been _in the game_ for nearly 20 years.

I'm an evangelist for clear, repeatable processes, cohesive team-building, and engineering excellence. I'm interested in specific outcomes but not very interested in specific technologies and generally learn them as required to help me create better engineering outcomes - I'm always happy to pick up a better hammer.

I don't write code I wouldn't sign my name against, and will always emphasise the importance of putting quality above all other considerations. I have an aversion to complexity and work to eliminate it everywhere I can, whether that be in code, in documentation, or in soft skills - team management, stakeholder engagement, etc.

In my spare time I run [a car forum](https://ozvolvo.org) and as a result am technically an active PHP developer.

I don't spend much of my downtime at a computer so my personal repos here are just a collection of mostly scrapbooking and assorted junk.
