## Hello

I'm James. In 1999 I found the _View Source_ button in Internet Explorer and the rest is history. I hold a **B Sc. Information Technology** and have been _in the game_ for nearly 20 years.

As an engineer I am a generalist, I seek out interesting problems where I can apply my broad skillset.

I'm an evangelist for clear, repeatable processes, strong team-building, and engineering excellence. I don't write code I wouldn't put my name to and firmly believe that, in software, all good things come from an unassailable quality-first approach.

In my spare time I run [a car forum](https://ozvolvo.org) and as a result am technically an active PHP developer ðŸ˜¬

I don't spend much of my downtime at a computer so my personal repos here are just a collection of scrapbooking and assorted junk, and some ancient JavaScript!
